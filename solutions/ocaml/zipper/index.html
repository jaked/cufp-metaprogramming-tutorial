<h1 id='generating_zipper_types_or_deriving_the_derivative'>Generating zipper types, or &#8220;deriving the derivative&#8221;</h1>

<p>Gerard Huet&#8217;s well-known functional pearl The Zipper shows a way to represent a tree that provides constant-time navigation and modification operations. The idea is to represent a pointer into the tree as a pair of the pointed-to subtree and the context in which it appears (that is, its parent node).</p>

<p>This exercise defines a Camlp4 filter which generates the associated zipper type (the type of the context) of a type.</p>

<p>The context of a subtree consists of the fields in the parent node&#8217;s constructor (other than the pointed-to subtree) and the parent&#8217;s parent (also represented as a context, until we get to the top of the tree). We also need to know which constructor (of the original type) it is, and, if the original type occurs more than once in the constructor, in which occurrence the subtree appears.</p>

<p>Here is a concrete example:</p>

<pre><code>type t = Leaf | Tree of t * t
type t&#39; = Top | Tree0 of t&#39; * t | Tree1 of t * t&#39;</code></pre>

<p>The zipper type <code>t&#39;</code> always has a <code>Top</code> constructor, and it has a <code>TreeN</code> for each occurrence of <code>t</code> in <code>Tree</code> (and similarly for other constructors), to indicate the position of the subtree. Constructors with no occurrence of the original type have no arm in the zipper type, since the original type can&#8217;t appear with the constructor as its context.</p>

<p>A pointer consists of a <code>t * t&#39;</code>. So if we have a tree</p>

<pre><code>Tree (Tree (Leaf, Leaf), Leaf)</code></pre>

<p>a pointer to the left child of the root is</p>

<pre><code>(Tree (Leaf, Leaf), Tree0 (Top, Leaf))</code></pre>

<p>We can then define functions to move the pointer in the tree and make modifications to it. See Huet&#8217;s paper for details.</p>

<h2 id='other_stuff'>Other stuff</h2>

<p>Once you have built and installed the code, you can try it by running e.g.</p>

<pre><code>camlp4of -I `ocamlfind query zipper` zipper.cmo \
  -str &quot;type t = Leaf | Tree of t * t&quot;</code></pre>

<p>or use the <code>syntax_camlp4o</code> and <code>pkg_zipper</code> tags in your ocamlbuild <code>_tags</code> file.</p>

<h2 id='tasks'>Tasks</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>We have provided the filter boilerplate; fill in the code that generates the zipper type of a type. At first don&#8217;t worry about type parameters or occurrences of the type which are not directly under a constructor (e.g. in <code>Foo of bool * t</code> the type <code>t</code> occurs directly under a constructor, but in <code>Bar of int * (int * t)</code> it does not). Handle ordinary variants only.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Handle type parameters. Find out how they are represented in the AST, and when generating the zipper type check for occurrences of the type applied to its parameters. Don&#8217;t worry about non-regular type definitions; assume that the type is always applied to the same parameters with which it was declared. When comparing fragments of AST, you&#8217;ll want to ignore the locations somehow.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Generate navigation and modification functions for the zipper, following Huet&#8217;s paper. Generate a substitution function which recovers a tree of type <code>t</code> by substituting a tree of type <code>t</code> into a context of type <code>t&#39;</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Handle occurrences which are not directly under a constructor, but appear in a tuple as above, to any level of nesting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What other types could we reasonably handle? Mutually recursive types? Polymorphic variants? Records? Functions? Objects? Pick some and handle them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
