* revisit Jq_print
* keywords with trailing garbage are still parsed
* handle ints in number parsing
* handle exponents in number parsing
* be consistent with revised vs. original syntax
* get locations right
* have to do #camlp4o before #require "json_quot" at toplevel, why?
* return cleaned-up AST without extra constructors
   maybe Json_type from json-wheel?
* can we avoid strings in e.g. Jq_number, and always use Jq_Ant?
* simplify Jq_print.JSString?
* func to validate a Jq_ast.t? can blow up Jq_print with invalid
* be careful with trailing list comma in Jq_print
